## Getting Started
Read the system requirements, supported platforms, and installation guide for obtaining and using this Snap plugin.
### System Requirements 
* [golang 1.7+](https://golang.org/dl/) (needed only for building)

### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by snap:
* Linux/amd64
* Darwin/amd64

### Installation
The following sections provide a guide for obtaining the Syslog collector plugin.

#### Download
The simplest approach is to use ```go get``` to fetch and build the plugin. The following command will place the binary in your ```$GOPATH/bin``` folder where you can load it into snap.
```
$ go get github.com/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-awssqs
```

#### Building
The following provides instructions for building the plugin yourself if you decided to downlaod the source. We assume you already have a $GOPATH setup for [golang development](https://golang.org/doc/code.html). The repository utilizes [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) for library management.
```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/opsvision
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/opsvision
$ git clone http://github.com/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-awssqs
$ glide up

$ go install
```

#### Source structure
The following file structure provides an overview of where the files exist in the source tree. The [awssqs.go](https://github.com/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-awssqs/blob/master/awssqs/awssqs.go) file does all the work.
```
snap-plugin-publisher-awssqs
├── awssqs
│   └── awssqs.go
├── glide.yaml
├── LICENSE
├── main.go
├── metadata.yml
├── README.md
├── scripts
│   ├── load.sh
│   └── unload.sh
└── tasks
    └── awssqs.yaml
```

### Configuration and Usage
Set up the [Snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)

#### Load the Plugin
Once the framework is up and running, you can load the plugin.
```
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-publisher-awssqs
```

#### Task File
TBD
Once the task file has been created, you can create and watch the task.
```
$ snaptel task create -t awssqs.yaml
$ snaptel task list
ID                                       NAME                                         STATE     ...
f3ad05b2-3706-4991-ab29-c96e15813893     Task-f3ad05b2-3706-4991-ab29-c96e15813893    Running   ...
$ snaptel task watch f3ad05b2-3706-4991-ab29-c96e15813893
```

## Documentation
TBD

### Issues and Roadmap
* **Testing:** The testing being done is rudimentary at best. Need to improve the testing.

_Note: Please let me know if you find a bug or have feedbck on how to improve the collector._
